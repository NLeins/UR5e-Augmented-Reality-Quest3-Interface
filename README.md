# UR5e Augmented Reality Interface on Meta Quest 3

This repository contains the Unity project for controlling and programming a UR5e from Universal Robots. The app was developed for Meta Quest 3 and communicates with the robots via ROS2.

Unity-Version: 2022.3.50f (URP)

## ROS2 Setup

ROS2 needs to run the Universal Robots driver (https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver) and ROS TCP endpoint package (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Endpoint) to establish the connection between the robot and the Quest 3 application.
